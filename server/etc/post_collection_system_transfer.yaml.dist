# SAMPLE BLOCK --- INDENTS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE YAML-FORMAT ---
#- collectionSystemTransferName: SCS
#  commandList:
#  - name: r2rNavManager
#    command:
#    - python
#    - /usr/local/bin/r2rNavManager.py

# Breakdown of SAMPLE BLOCK
# Name of the collectionSystemTransfer to run after
#- collectionSystemTransferName: SCS
#
# Array of commands to run
#  commandList:
#
# The name of the command, used for messaging/error reporting, not part of the actual
# command(s) that are executed
#  - name: buildCruiseTracks
#
# This is the array containing the command to be executed. Each element when executed
# will be joined with a space ' '.  The following example would be called as:
# 'python /usr/local/bin/r2rNavManager.py SCS'
#    command:
#    - python
#    - /usr/local/bin/r2rNavManager.py
#    - SCS

# Wildcards:
# Wildcards can be used when defining command arrays (wildcards currently only work for the command array).
# Currenly implemented wildcards:
# - '{cruiseID}' --> the cruiseID used for the collectionSystemTransfer that just occurred 
# - '{collectionSystemTransferID}' --> the ID of the collectionSystemTransfer that just occurred 
# - '{collectionSystemTransferName}' --> the name of the collectionSystemTransfer that just occurred
# - '{loweringID}' --> the loweringID used for the collectionSystemTransfer that just occurred 
# - '{newFiles}' --> JSON-formatted array of all new files that were just transferred
# - '{updatedFiles}' --> JSON-formatted array of all updated files that were just transferred
#
# **** NOTE: Wild cards must be in quotes (') or will not work ****
