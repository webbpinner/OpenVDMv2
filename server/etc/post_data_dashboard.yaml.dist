# Breakdown of SAMPLE BLOCK
# Name of the collectionSystemTransfer to run after
#- collectionSystemTransferName: SCS
#
# Array of commands to run
#  commandList:
#
# The name of the command, used for messaging/error reporting, not part of the actual
# command(s) that are executed
#  - name: buildCruiseTracks
#
# This is the array containing the command to be executed. Each element when executed
# will be joined with a space ' '.  The following example would be called as:
# 'python /usr/local/bin/buildCruiseTracks.py SCS'
#    command:
#    - python
#    - /usr/local/bin/buildCruiseTracks.py
#    - SCS

# Wildcards:
# Wildcards can be used when defining command arrays (wildcards currently only work for the command array).
# Currenly implemented wildcards:
# - '{cruiseID}' --> the cruiseID used for the dataDashboard that just occurred 
# - '{collectionSystemTransferID}' --> the collectionSystemTransferID used for the dataDashboard that just occurred 
# - '{collectionSystemTransferName}' --> the collectionSystemTransferName used for the dataDashboard that just occurred 
# - '{newFiles}' --> JSON-formatted array of all new files that were just transferred in the cooresponding collectionSystemTransfer
# - '{updatedFile}' --> JSON-formatted array of all updated files that were just transferred in the cooresponding collectionSystemTransfer

#- collectionSystemTransferName: SCS
#  commandList:
#  - name: buildCruiseTracks
#    command:
#    - python
